title: About Me
---

I'm Head of Economics and Experimentation at [Zalando SE](https://www.zalando.de/). I lead teams of social data scientists and software engineers building and evaluating large-scale automated decision-making systems, including Zalando's A/B testing platform. I was previously a research fellow at the Institute for Quantitative Social Science, Harvard University developing statistical software for the social and physical sciences. I have held posts at City, University of London, the Hertie School of Governance, Yonsei University, and the London School of Economics where in 2012 he completed a PhD in quantitative political science.
