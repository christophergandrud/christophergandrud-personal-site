title: About
---

I'm Head of Economics and Experimentation at [Zalando SE](https://www.zalando.de/). I lead teams of social data scientists and software engineers building and evaluating large-scale automated decision-making systems, including Zalando's A/B testing platform. I was previously a research fellow at the Institute for Quantitative Social Science, Harvard University developing statistical software for the social and physical sciences. I've also held posts at City, University of London, the Hertie School of Governance, Yonsei University, and the London School of Economics where in 2012 I completed a PhD in quantitative political science.
