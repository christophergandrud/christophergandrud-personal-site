# My journey to the character

Alexander Masters' *A Life Discarded* (2016) explores 148 diaries that his friends found in a skip in Cambridge. I've really enjoyed all of Masters' books; a loving biographies of Cambridge oddballs that makes that town seem about as eccentric and moldy as it likely is. 

One great joy of the book is its tour of ~50 years of notebooks and the information they came printed with.

It comes from Latin, [meaning](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scruple) a "pointed stone". 

I'm not sure why scruple came to also mean "to have doubt about doing something one thinks is wrong". 15 minutes of google-ing did not reveal the connection.
