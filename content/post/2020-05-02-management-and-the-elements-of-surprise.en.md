## Intro 

A research team, a department, a company is at some fundamental level just:

> a bunch of people talking to each other

Hopefully, when people talk to each other, they convey the meaning they intended to the people they are talking to. This can be a very hard thing to do in practice. We all have many experiences being misunderstood.

If a company is "a bunch of people talking to each other", the role of a manager is in part to help people successfully talk to each other. Given the fundamental problem of miscommunication, this is a challenging career. This challenge is also one of the main reasons I find management to be a satisfying career. 

## Reframing: miscommunication to puzzle

Vera Tobin's (2018) book "Elements of Surprise: Our Mental Limits and the Satisfactions of Plot" helped me both understand better why my work is challenging and why this can also be very satisfying. 

"Elements" is about the rhetorical tools authors use to create surprises in literature and why these surprises are so compelling. A key way that authors surprise us is by playing with the "curse of knowledge": the more information and experience we have, the harder it is to step outside of that experience. This curse:

> . . . shapes our expectations of what other people are likely to know and do and even affects our memories of how we felt before we knew it. (2018, 16)



What does this have to do with management?
