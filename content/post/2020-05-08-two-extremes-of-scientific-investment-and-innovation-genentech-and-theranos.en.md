## The contrast

How can we successfully pair capital and research to produce genuine innovations that bring real value to many people? Two silicon valley biotech companies with very different trajectories highlight some factors that may be involved. The two companies are Genentech and Theranos.

Both venture capital funded companies started in silicon valley with the aim to create valuable products on top of basic scientific research. Founded in 1976, Genentech has been [enduringly successful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genentech#Products_timeline) since it's first breakthrough in 1982. It created synthetic insulin, the first human genetically engineered human therapeutic. Theranos was founded in 2003. It claimed to be developing a dramatically more patient friendly blood testing method, but ended not really producing much, except a lot of court cases. Superficially similar, their early investors were quite different in how:

- technically knowledgeable they were,

- actively they participated in corporate governance,

- much importance they put on transparency and collaboration with academic partners

### Genentech

The venture capital firm Kleiner & Perkins was an early investor in Genentech. Kleiner & Perkins epitomises an approach to investing that seeks to identify promising new technologies and actively invest in bringing them to market. In Nicholas' (2019) telling the driving force in the firm behind this approach was Tom Perkins. Tom Perkins had a BA in electrical engineering from MIT and an MBA from Harvard. Before investing in Genentech Perkins worked for, founded, and invested in a number of high tech companies. He was personally interested in scientific details. While working at Optics Technology in the 1960s, "he increasingly developed an interest in the science of laser technology" (Nicholas 2019, 207). He turned this interest into a new company called University Laboratories. From these experiences managing science, he co-founded Kleiner & Perkins with the aim of "providing a more systematic approach to seed capital deployment and governance in high-technology industries" (209). Kleiner & Perkins set out three investment principles in its original prospectus:

1. _Exposure_ to a wide variety of investment opportunities

2. Excellent _judgement_ in selecting only the best situations

3. The _ability to develop_ the investment

(211, emphasis in the original). The investment firm was founded on the principle to be knowledgeable in the technology and actively use this expertise to develop and de-risk the new company. 

When Genentech founder--UCSF biochemist Bob Swanson approached Kleiner & Perkins for a founding investment in 1976, he asked for $2 million for laboratory space, equipment, and salaries. 

> "Perkins pushed back, encouraging Swanson to consider financially leaner alternatives. Swanson returned to Perkins with a plan to subcontract out to local universities and research centers. Perkins agreed to invest $100,000." (Nicholas 2019, 218).

Working with labs at UCSF, a private California hospital, and CalTech allowed Genentech to take advantage of a wider range of scientific skills. Through the end of the 1970s, Swanson worked on a "proof of principle first" for creating synthetic insulin, focusing the highest risk part of the research problem. The proof was successful and "produced patents and scientific articles that signaled Genentech's commitment to world-class basic research" (Nicholas 2019, 219). Despite being a minority investor in Genentech, Perkins 

### Theranos

Carreyrou (2018) tells the story of Theranos as a company that is secretive with its investors and isolated from the broader science community.  The idea for new ways to conduct medical tests began as an academic project by Elizabeth Holmes while she was an undergrad at Stanford. But it quickly strayed away from active academic collaboration and especially transparency. The types of investors that provided Theranos with its capital are notable for their lack of technical experience and that they didn't require transparency and corporate governance scrutiny.

For example, early investors included the father of a childhood friend whose firm previously invested in consumer ventures, like Hotmail. Other investors did not have experience in biotech, but instead where "corporate turn around specialists", "real estate and private equity investor[s]" (Carreyrou 2018. 15-16). Theranos was able to secure enough funding from these sources to set up its own secretive lab.

When Holmes pitched her startup to investors experienced with the medical industry, she was unsuccessful. Carreyrou describes her pitch to MedVenture Associates: 

> she spoke quickly and in grand terms about the potential her technology had to change mankind. But when MedVenture partners asked for more specifics about her microchip system and how it would differ from one that had already been developed and commercialized by a company called Abaxis, she got visibly flustered and the meeting grew tense. Unable to answer the partners' probing technical questions, she got up after about an hour and left in a huff. (2018, 16)

While Holmes may have started out with some promising ideas and attracted considerable investment, they never cracked core scientific problems behind the product ambition. Instead of cutting her losses, Holmes dug in using charisma to attract investors, non-disclosure agreements to silence employees who came to realise that the science was not there, and hijinks to obscure what was actually being developed. For example, the company created a well aesthetically pleasing box--the "Edison Box"--with a robotic arm inside to conduct tests. It was noisy, dangerous, and would occasional break the test tubes it was handling, and produced highly inaccurate test results. It "seemed like something a middle-schooler could build in his garage" (Carreyrou 2018, 186). 

The promise of the Theranos product was that they could do a wide range of tests with a small painless prick, rather than the usual blood draw with a syringe. The science to make this possible never materialised. Without a real product, they took small blood samples, diluted them, and then ran them through otherwise accurate Siemens blood analyzers. This produced marketdely less accurate results. Without investor, scientific, and regulatory scrutiny, Theranos continued this damaging work for many years. 

> "By using its proprietary devices only within the walls oft own laboratory and not seeking to commercialize them, it was able to continue to avoid close FDA [Federal Drug Administration] scrutiny." (Carreyrou 2018, 260)

## Conclusions: Be transparent, don't waste your time

Transparency, active knowledgeable investors, and collaboration with academic partners aren't guarantees of success. Basic research is high risk. We don't even know if a solution exists. However, transparency, collaboration, and active knowledgeable investors help are important because they help identify faster if solutions exist. If solutions don't exist (at least not on the research path being pursed), they help identify this faster too. Enabling everyone to move onto other promising projects, rather than going deepening on projects that aren't likely to have meaningful results. [Koning et al. (2019)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26278) similarly find that startups that use A/B testing are more successful or fail faster. Scientific principles help us identify what works and what doesn't so we can make better business decisions.

Note that much of the gains don't necessarily come from open science as in completely accessible. Genentech and its consetlation of subcontracting universities were not necessarily open to the wider scientific community until the patent/publication stage.  Instead, much of the gains come from being transparent with experts who are in the position to scrutinise. 

For me the biggest lesson of Theranos: turning away from scientific best practice with secrecy and weak governance resulted in a ton of wasted time and talent. Genentech provides an example of how engaging with scientific best practice and having skilled investors holding founders accountable can produce great scientific and business results.
