## The contrast

How can we successfully **pair capital and research** to produce genuine innovations that bring real value to many people? Two silicon valley biotech companies with very different trajectories highlight some factors that may be involved. The two companies are Genentech and Theranos.

Both venture-capital-funded companies started in silicon valley with the aim to create valuable products based on new scientific research. Founded in 1976, Genentech has been [enduringly successful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genentech#Products_timeline) since its first breakthrough in 1982 when it created synthetic insulin, the first genetically engineered human therapeutic. Theranos was founded in 2003. It claimed to be developing a dramatically more patient-friendly blood testing method, but ended up not really producing much, except a lot of court cases. Superficially similar, their **early investors** were quite different in how:

- **technically knowledgeable** they were,

- actively they participated in corporate **governance**,

- much importance they put on **transparency** and **collaboration** with academic partners

### Genentech

The venture capital firm Kleiner & Perkins was an early investor in Genentech. Kleiner & Perkins epitomises an approach to investing that seeks to identify promising new technologies and actively invest in bringing them to market. In Nicholas' (2019) telling the driving force in the firm behind this approach was Tom Perkins. Tom Perkins had a BA in electrical engineering from MIT and an MBA from Harvard. Before investing in Genentech, Perkins worked for, founded, and invested in a number of basic science focused high tech companies. He was personally interested in the scientific details. While working at Optics Technology in the 1960s, "he increasingly developed an interest in the science of laser technology" (Nicholas 2019, 207). He then turned this interest into a new company called University Laboratories. From these experiences managing science, he co-founded Kleiner & Perkins with the aim of "providing a more systematic approach to seed capital deployment and governance in high-technology industries" (209). Kleiner & Perkins set out three investment principles in its original prospectus:

1. _Exposure_ to a wide variety of investment opportunities

2. Excellent _judgement_ in selecting only the best situations

3. The _ability to develop_ the investment

(211, emphasis in the original). The investment firm was founded on the principle to be knowledgeable in the technology and actively use this expertise to develop and de-risk the new company. 

When Genentech cofounder--UCSF biochemist Bob Swanson approached Kleiner & Perkins for a founding investment in 1976, he asked for $2 million for laboratory space, equipment, and salaries. 

> "Perkins pushed back, encouraging Swanson to consider financially leaner alternatives. Swanson returned to Perkins with a plan to subcontract out to local universities and research centers. Perkins agreed to invest $100,000." (Nicholas 2019, 218).

Despite being a minority investor in Genentech, Perkins was actively involved in the governance of the Genentech. For many years "he spent an afternoon per week at Genentech". 

> "Kleiner & Perkin's association with Genentech epitomized what good governance meant from the standpoint of a professional venture capital firm. Perkins had advocated the lean startup approach, insisting on outsoucing, experimentation, and staged financing as a way to de-risking the business." (Nicholas 2019, 220)

Working with labs at UCSF, a private California hospital, and Caltech allowed Genentech to take advantage of a **wider range of scientific skills and scrutiny**. Through the end of the 1970s, Swanson worked on a **"proof of principle first"** for creating synthetic insulin, focusing the highest risk part of the research problem. The proof was successful and "produced patents and scientific articles that signaled Genentech's commitment to world-class basic research" (Nicholas 2019, 219). 



### Theranos

Carreyrou (2018) tells the story of Theranos as a company that is **secretive with its investors** and **isolated from the broader science community**. The business idea--an easier way to do blood tests--began as an academic project by Elizabeth Holmes while she was an undergrad at Stanford. But the business quickly **strayed away from active academic collaboration**. The types of investors that provided Theranos with its capital are notable for their **lack of technical expertise**. These investors were hands-off and didn't require scientific transparency.

For example, early investors included the father of Holmes' childhood friend whose firm previously invested in consumer ventures, like Hotmail. Other investors did not have experience in biotech, but instead were "corporate turn around specialists", and "real estate and private equity investor[s]" (Carreyrou 2018. 15-16). In contrast to Genentech, Theranos was able to secure enough funding from early investors to set up its own secretive lab.

Holmes was unsuccessful when she pitched her startup to experienced medical industry investors. Carreyrou describes her pitch to MedVenture Associates: 

> "she spoke quickly and in grand terms about the potential her technology had to change mankind. But when MedVenture partners asked for more specifics about her microchip system and how it would differ from one that had already been developed and commercialized by a company called Abaxis, she got visibly flustered and the meeting grew tense. Unable to answer the partners' probing technical questions, she got up after about an hour and left in a huff." (2018, 16)

While Holmes may have started out with some promising ideas and attracted considerable investment, Theranos never cracked the core scientific problems behind their product ambitions. Instead of cutting her losses, Holmes dug in. She used charisma to attract investors, non-disclosure agreements to silence employees, and hijinks to obscure what was actually being developed. For example, the company created an aesthetically pleasing box--the "Edison Box"--with a robotic arm inside to do blood analysis. The box was noisy, dangerous, would occasional break the test tubes it was handling, and produced highly inaccurate test results. It "seemed like something a middle-schooler could build in his garage" (Carreyrou 2018, 186). 

The promise of the Theranos product was that it could do a wide range of tests with a small painless prick, rather than the usual blood draw with a syringe. The science to make this possible never materialised. Without a real product, they took small blood samples, diluted them, and then ran them through otherwise accurate Siemens blood analyzers. This produced much less accurate results. 

Without investor, scientific, and regulatory scrutiny, Theranos continued this damaging work for many years. 

> "By using its proprietary devices only within the walls of its own laboratory and not seeking to commercialize them, it was able to continue to avoid close FDA [Federal Drug Administration] scrutiny." (Carreyrou 2018, 260)

## Conclusions: Be transparent, don't waste your time

Transparency, active knowledgeable investors, and collaboration with academic partners aren't guarantees of success. Basic research is high risk; researchers and investors never know definitivelu know in advance if a solution exists for the problem they're working on. However, transparency, collaboration, and active, knowledgeable investors can help a new company more quickly identify whether solutions exist. If solutions don't exist (at least not on the research path being pursed), they help identify this faster too. This information enables founders and investors to move onto other promising projects, rather than sinking further into projects that aren't likely to have meaningful results. [Koning et al. (2019)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26278) similarly find that startups that use A/B testing are more successful or fail faster. 

Scientific principles help us identify what works and what doesn't so we can make better business decisions.
