<h2>The basic attribution problem</h2>
<p>The tools of causal inference–particularly the concepts of necessary and sufficient causation–are central to solving the e-commerce <strong>attribution problem</strong>. The e-commerce attribution problem is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>how much of the value of an outcome should we ascribe to a given customer touch point out of a set of touch points that preceded the outcome?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, a customer buys a t-shirt. What value should we ascribe to the multiple touch points where the customer saw and interacted with the t-shirt: Facebook ads for the t-shirt, on-site recommendations for the t-shirt, putting the t-shirt in their wishlist, putting the t-shirt in their cart, checkout out the t-shirt? The e-commerce attribution problem is a version of the “causes of effects” problem discussed by <span class="citation">Gelman and Imbens (2013)</span> and <span class="citation">Yamamoto (2012)</span>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Why is this problem important?</em> Solving the attribution problem helps us make better decisions about how to invest in developing customer touch points (e.g. Facebook marketing, on-site recommendations, etc.) that are most likely to achieve our business objectives (e.g. increase sales). We want to invest in the touch points that are most likely to cause <em>incremental</em> value.</p>
<div id="the-checkout-attribution-problem" class="section level3">
<h3>The checkout attribution problem</h3>
<p>To understand how to solve the attribution problem, let’s think about a simple concrete example: the checkout attribution problem. Imagine we are interested in attributing value to the touch points that lead to the sale of a product. There are three possible customer touch points leading to a sale: off-site advertising, on-site recommendations, and checkout. All sales must include interacting with the checkout:</p>

</center>
<p>What value should we attribute to each of these touch points? Since all customer journeys to a sale have to go through the checkout, does this mean that we should attribute all of the value of the sale to the checkout? The answer is “no”, but to understand why we need to make a distinction between necessary and sufficient causal conditions <span class="citation">(Pearl 1999, 2018, 287–91)</span></p>
<div id="necessary-vs.-sufficient-causation" class="section level4">
<h4>Necessary vs. sufficient causation</h4>
<p>Let’s represent a sale as <span class="math inline">\(y = 1\)</span> and no sale as <span class="math inline">\(y = 0\)</span>. When a customer experiences a touch point (advertising, recommendations, checkout) then <span class="math inline">\(x_{\mathrm{ad}} = 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_{\mathrm{reco}} = 1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(x_{\mathrm{checkout}} = 1\)</span>, 0 otherwise.</p>
<p>Rather than thinking about whether a given touch point is <em>a</em> necessary or sufficient condition, let’s consider their <em>probability</em> of necessity and sufficiency.</p>
<p>The <strong>probability of necessity</strong> for a given touch point <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PN}_x\)</span>) is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathrm{PN}_x = P(y_{x = 0} = 0| x = 1, y = 1).
\]</span></p>
<p>This expresses a counterfactual scenario. Give that the condition happened <span class="math inline">\((x = 1)\)</span> and there was a sale <span class="math inline">\((y = 1)\)</span> , what is the probability that the sale would not have happened had condition <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> not have happened? The checkout has high probability of necessity for sale because the probability that a sale occurs without a checkout is 0. Advertising and recommendations have lower probability of necessity. A sale could still happen if a customer saw a recommendation, but not advertising and vice versa.</p>
<p>The <strong>probability of sufficiency</strong> for a given touch point <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PS}_x\)</span>) is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathrm{PS}_x = P(y_{x = 1} = 1| x = 0, y = 0).
\]</span></p>
<p>This time the counterfactual scenario is: given that the condition <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> did not happen and there was no sale, what is the probability that a sale would have happened had the condition happened? Checkout has a low probability of sufficiency. If a customer is only exposed to a checkout page they probably won’t purchase. Advertising and recommendations have higher sufficiency. If a customer sees either an advertisement or a recommendation for a product they are more likely to purchase.</p>
<p>In sum:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Touch Point</th>
<th>PN</th>
<th>PS</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Advertisement</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Higher</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Recommendation</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Higher</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Checkout</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Very Low</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So what?</p>
<p>Let’s remember the problem we are trying to solve: decide how much to invest in each touch point to increase our incremental return. Once we have already decided to invest in necessary touch points, <em>knowing a touch point’s probability of sufficiency is more important than its probability of necessity for further investment decisions</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="implications" class="section level4">
<h4>Implications</h4>
<p>Let’s make this simple example more concrete to see the implications for decision-making. Imagine the following (completely fictional) numbers:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Touch Point</th>
<th>PN</th>
<th>PS</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Advertisement</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0.1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Recommendation</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0.05</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Checkout</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We have a two step decision making process:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Decide where we <em>must</em> invest. The probability of necessity helps us make this decision. We <em>must</em> invest in the checkout or there will be no sales (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PS}_{checkout} = 1\)</span>). However, we will have no sales if we only invest in a checkout <span class="math inline">\(PS_\mathrm{checkout} = 0\)</span>. So we then . . .</p></li>
<li><p>Decide where to invest to increase our incremental sales. For this we use the touch point’s probability of sufficiency. Based the probabilities in this example, we should invest twice as much in advertising than recommendations (<span class="math inline">\(\frac{\mathrm{PS}_{ad}}{\mathrm{PS}_{reco}} = 2\)</span>), assuming their marginal return on each investment is proportional to their probability of sufficiency and there is the ability and some reason to invest in both.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>How do we find these incremental probabilities? We need causal inference methods like A/B testing and quasi-experimental methods.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> We don’t need these methods for touch points with high probability of necessity. They are so obviously necessary that we wouldn’t want to do an A/B test because the consequences of turning them off would be obviously catastrophic.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Pearl (2018, 290–91)</span> argues that distinguishing between necessary and sufficient probabilities is crucial for all automated decision-making systems, including AI generally. Without it, we will not be able to build sensible decision making systems that can reason about causes.</p>
