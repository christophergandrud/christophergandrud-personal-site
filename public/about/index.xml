      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Head of Economics and Experimentation at Zalando SE. I lead teams of social data scientists and software engineers building and evaluating large-scale automated decision-making systems, including Zalando&amp;rsquo;s A/B testing platform. I was previously a research fellow at the Institute for Quantitative Social Science, Harvard University developing statistical software for the social and physical sciences. I&amp;rsquo;ve also held posts at City, University of London, the Hertie School of Governance, Yonsei University, and the London School of Economics where in 2012 I completed a PhD in quantitative political science.</description>
