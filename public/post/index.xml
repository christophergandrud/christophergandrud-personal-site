      <description>The attribution problem: necessary vs. sufficient conditions of causation The tools of causal inference&amp;ndash;particularly the concepts of necessary and sufficient causation&amp;ndash;are central to solving the e-commerce attribution problem. The e-commerce attribution problem is:
 how much of the value of an outcome should we ascribe to a given customer touch point out of a set of touch points that preceded the outcome?
 For example, a customer buys a t-shirt. What value should we ascribe to the multiple touch points where the customer saw and interacted with the t-shirt: Facebook ads for the t-shirt, on-site recommendations for the t-shirt, putting the t-shirt in their wishlist, putting the t-shirt in their cart, checkout out the t-shirt?</description>

      <description>The contrast How can we successfully pair capital and research to produce genuine innovations that bring real value to many people? Two silicon valley biotech companies with very different trajectories highlight some factors that may be involved. The two companies are Genentech and Theranos.
Both venture-capital-funded companies started in silicon valley with the aim to create valuable products based on new scientific research. Founded in 1976, Genentech has been enduringly successful since its first breakthrough in 1982 when it created synthetic insulin, the first genetically engineered human therapeutic.</description>

 My journey to the character Alexander Masters&amp;rsquo; A Life Discarded (2016) explores 148 diaries that his friends found in a skip in Cambridge. I&amp;rsquo;ve really enjoyed all of Masters&amp;rsquo; books; a loving biographies of Cambridge oddballs that makes that town seem about as eccentric and moldy as it likely is.

Intro A research team, a department, a company is at some fundamental level just:
 a bunch of people talking to each other
