      <description>℈ scruple  a small unit in the apothecaries&amp;rsquo; system equal to 20 grains (wiki)
 My journey to the character Alexander Masters&amp;rsquo; A Life Discarded (2016) explores 148 diaries that his friends found in a skip in Cambridge. I&amp;rsquo;ve really enjoyed all of Masters&amp;rsquo; books; a loving biographies of Cambridge oddballs that makes that town seem about as eccentric and moldy as it likely is.
One great joy of the book is its tour of ~50 years of notebooks and the information they came printed with.</description>
